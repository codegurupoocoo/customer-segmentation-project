# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and identify customer segments using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering techniques. It leverages customer, product, and transaction data to provide actionable insights for marketing and business strategies.

The key steps involved in the project include:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gaining insights into customer demographics, sales trends, and product characteristics.
2. **Customer Clustering**: Using KMeans clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.
3. **Lookalike Model**: Identifying similar customers based on transaction patterns to improve targeting.

## Project Structure

The project repository contains the following folders and files:

```
repository/
├── EDA/
│   ├── FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb      # Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis
│   ├── FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf        # PDF report summarizing EDA findings
├── Lookalike/
│   ├── FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook for lookalike model
│   ├── FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv   # CSV file with lookalike results
├── Clustering/
│   ├── FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook for clustering analysis
│   ├── FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf    # PDF report with clustering insights
├── README.md  # This file
```

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the project:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

To install the necessary libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have the `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/customer-segmentation-project.git
   cd customer-segmentation-project
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   You can open and run the notebooks using Jupyter. For example:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb
   ```

3. **View the Reports**:
   PDF reports for EDA and Clustering are available in the `EDA/` and `Clustering/` folders. They provide a summary of the analysis and insights.

## Project Insights

- **EDA**: Summary of customer demographics, sales patterns, and high-value customers.
- **Clustering**: Segmenting customers into groups for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Lookalike Model**: Identifying customers similar to top buyers to improve sales and retention.
